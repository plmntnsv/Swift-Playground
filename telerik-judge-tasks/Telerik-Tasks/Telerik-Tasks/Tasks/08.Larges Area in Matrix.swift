/*
 Write a program that finds the largest area of equal neighbour elements in a rectangular matrix and prints its size.
 
 Input
 On the first line you will receive the numbers N and M separated by a single space
 On the next N lines there will be M numbers separated with spaces - the elements of the matrix
 Output
 Print the size of the largest area of equal neighbour elements
 Constraints
