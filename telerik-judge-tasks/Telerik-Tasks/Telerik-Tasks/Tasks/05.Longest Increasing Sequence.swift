/*
 Write a program that finds the length of the maximal increasing sequence in an array of N integers.
 
 Input
 Read from the standard input
 
 On the first line you will receive the number N
 On the next N lines the numbers of the array will be given
 
 Output
 Print to the standard output
 
 Print the length of the maximal increasing sequence
