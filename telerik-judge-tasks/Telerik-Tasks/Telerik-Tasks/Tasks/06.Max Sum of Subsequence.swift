/*
 Write a program that finds the maximal sum of consecutive elements in a given array of N numbers.
 
 _Can you do it with only one loop (with single scan through the elements of the array)?_
 Input
 On the first line you will receive the number N
 On the next N lines the numbers of the array will be given
 Output
 Print the maximal sum of consecutive numbers
 Constraints
 1 <= N <= 1024
